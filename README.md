# Live-Share-Demonstration
This is what I use to demonstrate the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack">VS Code Live Share Extension</a> to those unfamiliar with it.

<h3>The files included are as follows:</h3>


  Cool Site.html (used with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">Live Server Extension</a> to demonstrate the port forwarding ability)
  
  Edit This.txt (just a text file to edit)
  
  Snake.gif (used to demonstrate the image viewing ability of VS Code, also used in Cool Site.html)
  
  Test.py (used to demonstrate the terminal sharing ability)
